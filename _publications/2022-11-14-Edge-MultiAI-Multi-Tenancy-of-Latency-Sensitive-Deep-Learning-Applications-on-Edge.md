excerpt: "Smart IoT-based systems often desire continuous
execution of multiple latency-sensitive Deep Learning (DL) applications. The edge servers serve as the cornerstone of such IoTbased systems, however, their resource limitations hamper the
continuous execution of multiple (multi-tenant) DL applications.
The challenge is that, DL applications function based on bulky
“neural network (NN) models” that cannot be simultaneously
maintained in the limited memory space of the edge. Accordingly,
the main contribution of this research is to overcome the memory
contention challenge, thereby, meeting the latency constraints
of the DL applications without compromising their inference
accuracy. We propose an efficient NN model management framework, called Edge-MultiAI, that ushers the NN models of the
DL applications into the edge memory such that the degree of
multi-tenancy and the number of warm-starts are maximized.
Edge-MultiAI leverages NN model compression techniques, such
as model quantization, and dynamically loads NN models for
DL applications to stimulate multi-tenancy on the edge server.
We also devise a model management heuristic for Edge-MultiAI,
called iWS-BFE, that functions based on the Bayesian theory
to predict the inference requests for multi-tenant applications,
and uses it to choose the appropriate NN models for loading,
hence, increasing the number of warm-start inferences. We
evaluate the efficacy and robustness of Edge-MultiAI under
various configurations. The results reveal that Edge-MultiAI can
stimulate the degree of multi-tenancy on the edge by at least 2×
and increase the number of warm-starts by ≈ 60% without any
major loss on the inference accuracy of the applications.<br/><img src='/images/edge-multiai.png' alt="Edge MultiAI" style="width: 30%; height: auto;">"

Offering people rewards and incentives typically improves their performance on skilled motor tasks. However, the mechanisms by which motivation impacts motor skills remains unclear. In two experiments, we show that motivation impacts motor sequencing skills in two separate ways. First, the prospect of reward speeds up the execution of all actions. Second, rewards provide an additional boost to motor planning when explicit skill knowledge can be used to prepare movements in advance.
