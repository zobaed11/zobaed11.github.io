excerpt: "Cloud-based enterprise search services (e.g., Amazon Kendra) are enchanting to big data owners by
providing them with convenient search solutions over their enterprise big datasets. However, individuals
and businesses dealing with confidential big data (e.g., criminal reports) are reluctant to fully embrace
such cloud services due to valid data privacy concerns. Solutions based on client-side encryption have been
developed to mitigate these concerns. Nonetheless, such solutions hinder data processing, especially, data
clustering, which is pivotal in applications such as real-time search on large corpora (e.g., big datasets). To
cluster encrypted big data, we propose privacy-preserving clustering schemes, called ClusPr, for three forms
of unstructured datasets, namely static, semi-dynamic, and dynamic. ClusPr functions based on statistical
characteristics of the datasets to: (A) determine the suitable number of clusters; (B) populate the clusters with
topically relevant tokens; and (C) adapt the cluster set based on the dynamism of the underlying dataset.
Experimental results, obtained from evaluating ClusPr against other schemes in the literature, on three
different test datasets demonstrate between 30% to 60% improvement on the cluster coherency. Moreover,
we notice that employing ClusPr within a privacy-preserving enterprise search system can reduce the search
time by up to 78%, while improving the search accuracy by up to 35%.<br/><img src='/images/clustering.png'>"

Research in psychophysics argues that incentivized sensorimotor decisions (such as deciding where to reach to get a reward) maximize expected gain, suggesting that these decisions may be impervious to cognitive biases and heuristics. We tested this hypothesis in two experiments, directly comparing the predictive accuracy of an optimal model and plausible suboptimal models. We obtained strong evidence that people deviated from the optimal strategy by excessively avoiding loss regions when the potential loss was zero and failing to shift far enough away from loss regions when potential losses outweighed the potential gains. Although allowing nonlinear distortions of value and probability information improved the fit of value-maximizing models, behavior was best described by a model encapsulating a simple heuristic strategy. This suggests that visuomotor decisions are likely influenced by biases and heuristics observed in more classical economic decision-making tasks.
