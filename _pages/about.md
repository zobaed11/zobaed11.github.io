Hello and welcome!

I am Sm Zobaed, and currently, working as an Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. Besides teaching, I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a specialization in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I used to work as a Data Scientist in a Silicon Valley-based AI-driven startup named Cognomotiv Inc. Over the past few years, I have been privileged to harness the power of data and AI to solve complex problems, contributing significantly to the tech industry.
Following this role, I joined Lincoln University, PA, as a tenure-track faculty member, further expanding my expertise in both academic and industry settings.

My journey in data science began after completing my Ph.D. in Computer Science, which sparked my interest in the intersection of technology, data, and machine learning. In recent years, I have specialized in state-of-the-art NLP and large language models (LLMs), employing advanced frameworks like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangChain to enhance AI solutions across various applications. I have experience working with LangChain to build pipelines that connect language models with real-time data sources, significantly improving the accuracy and contextual relevance of responses.


Aside from technical skills, I'm also an effective project leader. I've led projects in various domains, demonstrating my strong work ethic, problem-solving skills, and ability to successfully complete projects within strict timeframes.
I'm always eager to explore new opportunities and challenges in the field of data science and machine learning. I believe in the power of continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends and technologies.

Feel free to browse my website to learn more about my projects and experiences or reach out if you're interested in collaborating. I look forward to connecting with you!

Best,
Sm Zobaed, Ph.D.
