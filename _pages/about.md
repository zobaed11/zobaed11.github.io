I am a PhD candidate in the [Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience Area](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/program-areas/cognition-and-cognitive-neuroscience.html) of the Department of Psychology at the University of Michigan. I am supported by a [Rackham Merit Fellowship](https://rackham.umich.edu/funding/funding-types/rackham-merit-fellowship-program/) and I collaborate with multiple research labs including the [Cognition, Control, and Action Lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/tarazlee-lab/), the [Lanugage and Cognitive Architecture Lab](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rickl/), the [Cognitive Neuroimaging Lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/jonides-lab/), and the [Basic and Applied Cognition Lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/shah-lab/). 

I am broadly interested in how perceptual, affective, cognitive, and motor systems in the human brain interact to support goal-directed behavior. I am inspired by philosophical questions about free will and consciousness and I approach these topics with rigorous multi-modal experimentation and quantitative analysis. My research approach consists of measuring and perturbing people's mind, brain, and behavior while they perform computerized tasks. My PhD thesis focuses on the cognitive processes that enable motivational cues to ehance the performance of perceptually-guided actions.  

I have experience developing attitudinal, behavioral, and neurophysiological experiments (`Python`,`JavaScript`), using Bayesian mathematical models to infer latent mental states from small behavioral datasets (`R`, `Stan`), using complex machine learning models to predict future behavior from large brain image datasets (`Python`), and communicating research methods and results to diverse audiences through visualizations, talks, and scientific articles.   

I am actively seeking positions in data science and user research so that I can apply my technical skills and domain knowledge to the development of cutting-edge technologies.
