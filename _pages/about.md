Hello and welcome!

I am Sm Zobaed, and currently, working as a Tenure-track Assistant Professor at Lincoln University. Besides teaching, I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a specialization in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I used to work as a Data Scientist in a Silicon Valley-based AI-driven startup named Cognomotiv Inc. Over the past few years, I have been privileged to harness the power of data and AI to solve complex problems, contributing significantly to the tech industry.

My journey in data science began after completing my Ph.D. in Computer Science, which sparked my interest in the intersection of technology, data, and machine learning. I've since developed advanced ML models for various domains, including multi-class and multi-label classification problems and CAN data anomaly detection.

One of the highlights of my career so far was my role in a large multi-class classification project, where I fine-tuned DistilBERT models to increase their subject knowledge expertise, resulting in a significant improvement in performance.

Aside from technical skills, I'm also an effective project leader. I've led projects in various domains, demonstrating my strong work ethic, problem-solving skills, and my ability to drive successful project completion within strict timeframes.

I'm always eager to explore new opportunities and challenges in the field of data science and machine learning. I believe in the power of continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends and technologies.

Feel free to browse my website to learn more about my projects and experiences or reach out if you're interested in collaborating. I look forward to connecting with you!

Best,
Sm Zobaed, Ph.D.
